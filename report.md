# Personal Todo List Application
## Final Project Report

### 1. Introduction

The Personal Todo List Application is a modern, user-friendly task management system developed as part of the COMP1002 Advanced Python course project. The application aims to provide users with an efficient and intuitive way to manage their daily tasks, with a focus on personalization and user experience.

**Project Goals:**
- Create a modern GUI application using Python
- Implement user authentication and personalization
- Provide efficient task management capabilities
- Ensure data persistence and reliability
- Follow Object-Oriented Programming principles
- Create a maintainable and extensible codebase

### 2. Technologies Used

**Core Technologies:**
- Python 3.13
- CustomTkinter (Modern GUI Framework)
- JSON (Data Storage)

**Key Libraries:**
- `customtkinter`: For modern UI components and theming
- `pillow`: For image handling and UI enhancements
- `colorama`: For terminal color support
- `tabulate`: For table formatting in backend operations

### 3. Implementation Details

#### 3.1 Architecture

The application follows a modular architecture with three main components:

1. **Data Layer (`todo.py`):**
   - `Task` class: Represents individual tasks with properties like title, description, due date, and completion status
   - `TodoList` class: Manages collections of tasks with methods for adding, removing, and filtering tasks

2. **Storage Layer (`storage.py`):**
   - Handles data persistence using JSON
   - Implements user-specific data storage
   - Provides methods for saving and loading task data

3. **Presentation Layer (`main.py`):**
   - Implements the GUI using CustomTkinter
   - Manages user interactions and input validation
   - Provides a modern, responsive interface

#### 3.2 Key Functionalities

1. **User Management:**
   - Personal user accounts
   - Persistent user data
   - Welcome screen with user authentication

2. **Task Management:**
   - Add new tasks with title, description, and due date
   - Mark tasks as complete/incomplete
   - Delete tasks
   - Filter tasks by completion status
   - Search tasks by title or description

3. **User Interface:**
   - Modern dark theme
   - Responsive layout
   - Intuitive navigation
   - Task cards with clear information display

### 4. Challenges & Solutions

#### 4.1 Challenge: GUI Framework Selection
**Problem:** Initial implementation used standard Tkinter, which lacked modern UI capabilities.
**Solution:** Switched to CustomTkinter for a more modern look and better user experience.

#### 4.2 Challenge: Data Persistence
**Problem:** Need to maintain separate task lists for multiple users.
**Solution:** Implemented a JSON-based storage system with user-specific data files.

#### 4.3 Challenge: Date Handling
**Problem:** Complex date input and validation requirements.
**Solution:** Implemented a simple but effective date format (YYYY-MM-DD) with proper validation.

#### 4.4 Challenge: UI Responsiveness
**Problem:** Need to handle varying amounts of tasks efficiently.
**Solution:** Implemented scrollable task lists and optimized task display.
